# Work-Allocation

I've designed an Excel spreadsheet for the purpose of distributing tasks among a team in a way that ensures an equitable workload division. To achieve this, I've employed advanced Excel formulas to allocate tasks across multiple sheets. Additionally, I've integrated VBA to create a user-friendly button. When this button is pressed, it triggers the generation of a new workbook. This new workbook contains individual sheets, each assigned to a specific employee and populated with their respective tasks.
